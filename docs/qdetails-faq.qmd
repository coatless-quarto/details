# General Information

## What is the {details} extension for Quarto?

The `{details}` extension for Quarto is a filter that transforms fenced divs with
the `.details` class into collapsible `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements. 
For non-interactive formats like LaTeX, Word, and Typst, it automatically converts 
these sections into Quarto callout blocks.

## Why use {details} instead of raw HTML?

Using the `{details}` extension offers several advantages when compared to raw HTML:

- **Cleaner syntax**: Easier to write and read using Markdown-like syntax.
- **Format compatibility**: Works across HTML, PDF, Word, Typst, and more.
- **Rich features**: Accordion groups, conditional content, accessibility attributes

# Installation

## How do I install the {details} extension?

Run the following command in your terminal:
 
```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/details
```

This installs the extension into your project's `_extensions` directory.

## Is the {details} extension compatible with all Quarto versions?

The `{details}` extension requires Quarto v1.7 or later, as it uses Lua filter features stabilized in that version.

## Do I need to install any additional dependencies?

No additional dependencies are required. The `{details}` extension is a pure
Lua filter that works with Quarto's built-in Pandoc processing.

# Basic Usage

## How do I create a collapsible section?

Add the `.details` class to a fenced div:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Click to expand"}
Your collapsible content here.
:::
```

## What are the different ways to specify summary text?

There are three methods, in order of priority:

1. **Attribute**: `summary="Your text"` (plain text only)
2. **Summary div**: Nested `::: {.summary}` div (supports Markdown)
3. **Heading**: First heading in the block (supports Markdown)

If none are provided, the default text "Click to expand" is used.

## Can I have the details open by default?

Yes, add the `open` attribute:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Already expanded" open="true"}
This content is visible immediately.
:::
```

Or set it globally in your YAML:

```yaml
extensions:
  details:
    interactive:
      open: true
```

# Accordion Groups

## How do I create an accordion where only one section opens at a time?

Add the same `group` attribute to related details blocks:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Section 1" group="faq"}
Content 1
:::

::: {.details summary="Section 2" group="faq"}
Content 2
:::
```

This uses exclusive mode by default—opening one section closes the others.

## Can all sections in a group open and close together?

Yes, use synchronized mode:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Part A" group="notes" accordion-mode="synchronized"}
:::

::: {.details summary="Part B" group="notes" accordion-mode="synchronized"}
:::
```

Or set it globally:

```yaml
extensions:
  details:
    interactive:
      accordion-mode: "synchronized"
```

# Non-Interactive Formats

## How do details blocks appear in PDF or Word?

By default, they render as Quarto callout blocks with the summary as the title. 
You can control this with the `display` option:

- `"show"`: Full content in a callout (default)
- `"placeholder"`: Callout with placeholder text
- `"remove"`: Block is removed entirely

## Can I use different summary text for PDF vs HTML?

Yes, use the `non-interactive-summary` attribute:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Click to expand" non-interactive-summary="Additional Information"}
Content here.
:::
```

## How do I change the callout type?

Use the `callout-type` attribute or global setting:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Warning" callout-type="warning"}
:::
```

Available types: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, `important`

# Advanced Features

## Can I use Markdown formatting in summaries?

Yes, when using a heading or summary div:

```markdown
::: {.details}
## Click for **important** `code` details

Content here.
:::
```

The `summary` attribute only supports plain text.

## How do I show different content for HTML vs PDF?

Use conditional content divs:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Demo"}

::: {.interactive-only}
<iframe src="demo.html"></iframe>
:::

::: {.non-interactive-only}
See the online version for the interactive demo.
:::

:::
```

## Can I add expand/collapse all buttons?

Yes, enable controls in your YAML:

```yaml
extensions:
  details:
    interactive:
      show-controls: true
      controls-position: "top"  # or "bottom", "both"
```

## How do I link directly to a specific details section?

Add a custom ID:

```markdown
::: {#installation .details summary="Installation"}
Steps here.
:::
```

Then link with `#installation`. Without a custom ID, elements receive auto-generated IDs
(`details-1`, `details-2`, etc.).

# Troubleshooting

## The details blocks aren't collapsible. What should I check?

Ensure that:

1. The extension is installed in `_extensions/details/`
2. You've added `filters: [details]` to your YAML
3. You're rendering to an HTML format
4. The div has the `.details` class

## My accordion group isn't working correctly.

Verify that:

- All sections have the same `group` value
- You're viewing in an HTML format (accordions don't apply to PDF/Word)
- For synchronized mode, all sections include `accordion-mode="synchronized"`

## The expand/collapse buttons aren't appearing.

Check that:

- `show-controls: true` is set under `extensions.details.interactive`
- Your document contains at least one details block
- You're rendering to an HTML format

## How do I debug configuration issues?

Enable debug mode to see verbose logging:

```yaml
extensions:
  details:
    debug: true
```

This logs option parsing, summary extraction, ID generation, and more.

# Compatibility

## Does {details} work with all Quarto output formats?

Yes! The extension automatically adapts:

- **HTML formats** (html, revealjs, slidy, etc.): Native `<details>` elements
- **Non-interactive formats** (pdf, docx, typst, epub): Quarto callouts

## Can I use {details} with other Quarto extensions?

Yes, `{details}` is designed to work alongside other extensions. 
If you encounter conflicts, try adjusting the filter order in your YAML.

## Does {details} work in Quarto websites and books?

Yes, add the filter to your `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
filters:
  - details
```
