This guide demonstrates three ways to define the summary text for a details block.

# Setup

Install the `details` extension if you haven't already:

```sh
quarto add coatless-quarto/details
```

Then, in your Quarto document, make sure to include the `details` filter in your document's YAML header:

```md
---
title: "My Document"
filters: [details]
---
```

Or, if you want to enable the extension for all documents in your project, add the filter to your project's `_quarto.yml` file.
