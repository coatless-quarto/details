title: "Expand/Collapse Controls"
extensions:

    interactive:
      show-controls: true
      controls-position: "top"
filters: [details]
---

Within interactive formats, you can enable document-wide buttons to expand or
collapse all details sections at once. This does not affect non-interactive formats
as those do not have expandable/collapsible behavior.

## Configuration

Add the following to your document metadata or `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
---
extensions:
  details:
    interactive:
      show-controls: true
      controls-position: "top"  # "top", "bottom", or "both"
---
```

## Demo

Use the buttons at the top of the document to expand or collapse all sections.

::: {.details summary="Section 1: Introduction"}
This is the introduction section with some preliminary information.
:::

::: {.details summary="Section 2: Main Content"}
This is the main content section with detailed information.

- Point A
- Point B
- Point C
:::

::: {.details summary="Section 3: Examples"}
Here are some examples:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
:::

::: {.details summary="Section 4: Conclusion"}
This is the conclusion with final thoughts and next steps.

## Custom Button Text

To customize the text of the expand/collapse buttons, modify `controls-expand-text` and `controls-collapse-text` within
the `interactive` settings of thedocument metadata or `_quarto.yml`.

```yaml
---
extensions:
  details:
    interactive:
      show-controls: true
      controls-expand-text: "Show All"
      controls-collapse-text: "Hide All"
---
```

## Position Options

The `controls-position` attribute determines where the expand/collapse buttons appear:

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `"top"` | Controls at the start of the document (default) |
| `"bottom"` | Controls at the end of the document |
| `"both"` | Controls at both start and end |
