Details can be expanded by default using the `open` attribute or global configuration.

## Per-Element Configuration

```markdown
::: {.details open="true"}
This content is visible immediately.
:::
```

::: {.details open="true"}
# This is open by default
This content is visible immediately.
:::

::: {.details}
# This is closed by default
This content is hidden until clicked.
:::

## Global Configuration

Set all details to open by default:
 
```yaml
---
extensions:
  details:
    interactive:
      open: true
---
```

## Override Global Setting

When globally open, close specific elements with `open="false"`:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Stays closed" open="false"}
Hidden despite global setting.
:::
```
