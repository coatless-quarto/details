A Quarto extension for creating collapsible sections using `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements without writing raw HTML.

## Installation

To install the `details` Quarto extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Execute the following command:

```sh
quarto add coatless-quarto/details
```

This command will download and install the Quarto extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory of your Quarto project. If you are using version control, ensure that you include this directory in your repository.

## Usage

### Syntax with attribute

Use the `.details` class and specify the summary text with the `summary` attribute:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Click to see more"}
This content will be collapsible.

You can include **any** Markdown content here.
:::
```

Gives:

::: {.details summary="Click to see more"}
This content will be collapsible.

You can include **any** Markdown content here.
:::


### Syntax with heading as summary

Use any heading level as the summary text. The heading will be automatically extracted:


```markdown
::: {.details}
## Click to expand

This is the collapsible content that appears after the heading.

You can use any heading level: `##`, `###`, `####`, etc.
:::
```

Gives:

::: {.details}
## Click to expand

This is the collapsible content that appears after the heading.

You can use any heading level: `##`, `###`, `####`, etc.
:::

### Syntax with nested summary div

For multi-line or complex summaries, use a nested `.summary` div:

```markdown
::: {.details}
::: {.summary}
**Important:** Click to expand
:::

This is the collapsible content.

- Item 1
- Item 2
:::
```

Gives:

::: {.details}
::: {.summary}
**Important:** Click to expand
:::

This is the collapsible content.

- Item 1
- Item 2
:::

### Priority order

If multiple summary methods are used, the priority is:

1. **Attribute** (`summary="text"`) - highest priority
2. **Summary div** (`::: {.summary}`)
3. **First heading** (`##`, `###`, etc.)
4. **Default** ("Click to expand")

Example where attribute takes priority:

````markdown
::: {.details summary="This will be used"}
## This heading will be treated as content

Content here.
:::
````

Gives:

::: {.details summary="This will be used"}
## This heading will be treated as content

Content here.
:::

### Open by default

Add the `open="true"` attribute to make the details open by default:

```markdown
::: {.details summary="Already expanded" open="true"}
This content is visible by default.
:::
```

Gives:

::: {.details summary="Already expanded" open="true"}
This content is visible by default.
